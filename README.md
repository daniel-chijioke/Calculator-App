## ✨ Key Features
* **Full Arithmetic Suite:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with real-time result processing.
* **Intelligent Input Handling:** Features a specialized logic to handle decimal points and prevent multiple operators from being entered consecutively.
* **Responsive Grid Layout:** Built using CSS Grid and Flexbox to ensure the calculator remains perfectly centered and usable on all screen sizes, including mobile devices.
* **Clean & Modern UI:** Implements a dark-themed interface with polished button states, hover effects, and a clear display for both inputs and results.
* **Instant Clear Function:** Includes a "C" (Clear) function to reset the calculator state instantly for new computations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** Structured with a semantic layout for the display and button grid.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling featuring responsive design and interactive UI components.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** Functional programming for mathematical evaluations and DOM event listeners.

## 📂 Project Structure
* `index.html` - The structural entry point.
* `/styles/style.css` - UI layout and custom aesthetic rules.
* `/scripts/script.js` - Core arithmetic logic and event handling.
* `favicon.png` - Branded browser tab icon.

## 🧠 Technical Insight
In this project, I focused on creating a robust event-handling system. By capturing button clicks and filtering inputs, the application ensures that users can perform calculations without errors, providing a smooth and reliable desktop-like experience in the browser.
